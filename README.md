# Python-for-Everybody
Project files for the Michigan University course 'Python for Everybody'
I am completing the Coursera 'Python for Everybody' course in conjunction with the University of Michigan, in an attempt to make a career change into programming. I've been interested in programming for a long time, ever since learning HTML at age 8, but have been sidelined by the rest of life. Now is my moment!
